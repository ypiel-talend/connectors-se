MongoDB
two modes for input(single json output/basic/mapping) and output(single json input/basic/mapping), output aggreate group for array?
1. document output/document input(no schema setting), not as default
2. record with config mapping(no schema setting as it will included in the mapping table, the single and complex mapping with json path), as default

add a button("view document") for 1, to fill a readonly code(json) to show document for customer only
add a button for 2 like fileio auto detect, to fill the mapping table setting self with basic path. Make it easy to use
